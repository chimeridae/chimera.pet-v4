                                <li>Has the potential for a membership option, and other fun quirks for donos on my Twitch streams</li>

                                <li>Allows you to request refunds and track my progress</li>

                            <p>The only real con to Vgen is that it has a non-negotiable fee on my end, and my inexperience with the platform. At the end of the day, it's all up to your personal preference.</p>
