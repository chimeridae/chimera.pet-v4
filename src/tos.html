                    <li>Small edits to some artworks are okay, but I won't do large edits after-the-fact without an extra fee.</li>
                    <li>Refunds are only allowed in the circumstance that either I never start your commission within the allotted time period, or I am unable to finish your commission for any reason.</li>
                    <li>Finished commissions are inherently allowed for use in my portfolio unless requested otherwise by the client.</li>

                            <p><span class="stroke">Pros of Ko-fi:</span></p>

                                <li>Has the potential for a membership option, and other fun quirks for donos on my Twitch streams</li>

                                <li>This means I may have to refund you <b>after</b> you've paid if I feel unable to complete your request.</li>
                                <li>In addition, if you have a hard deadline or intend to use my work <b>commercially,</b> I would have to contact you personally for that extra fee.</li>
