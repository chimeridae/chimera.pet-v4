    This is my labor of love towards a series that I can proudly call home. Pokemon is an extremely important part of my life, and I wouldn't be where I am today without it. I hope you enjoy reading my thoughts on the series! This will include lots of personal memories, general opinions, as well as what I personally would consider "obscure" Pokemon information.
