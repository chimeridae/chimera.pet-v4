<p>i wrote this story out for an event on my friend critter's stream, and figured i'd post it here, too. the prompt was to submit scary stories. i spent a while trying to remember what i’d consider my scariest story that isn’t too “serious”, and i think this one is a good mix of scary and, in hindsight, a little silly - because it isn’t actually too eventful. this is a story of the time i stayed in a haunted hotel when i was just a kit. </p>

<p>this story takes place some time around 2009-2010, making me around 9 or 10 years old. my family took me on a road trip for the first time in my life, as well as my first time out of state! as a kit from a town of 1k people or less during childhood, this was a big feat to me. we went on a trip to hot springs, arkansas, and the place we decided to stay at was called the “velda rose”. this motel was opened in the 1960’s, and you could definitely tell! it was one of the last post-war hotels still operating by the time we stayed there. i can’t find any verifiable source on when it shut down for good, but it was certainly not long after. i remember the lobby being covered in gaudy retro red carpeting and gold-bronze trim, with cases displaying 40+ years of memorabilia. not only was it showing its age, but the only way to access the operational side of the hotel was through a sketchy elevator accessible through a side alleyway rather than the front of the huge building. this alone was enough to spook me!</p>

<p>i don’t remember the room we stayed in, but i do remember that we must have been one of the only people renting a room in the entire place. the only time you would see other people would be in the lobby, which housed typically one to two employees. to my family, this meant that we’d have free reign to explore the entire half-abandoned lot. nowadays i would jump at the notion of this - but it’s important to know some background of what i was like as a child: *very* easily frightened, often left alone at home, with a family that enjoyed terrorizing me for fun. included in this torment were the subjects of all things paranormal; i would frequently beg my family to please turn off “ghost hunters” at night, or scream-cry over episodes of “lost tapes”. with this in mind: imagine being me, an otherwise traumatized child around age 10, being forced to follow my family members around a hotel that’s near empty and falling apart beneath your feet… after midnight!</p>

<p>here’s the main event: with all of this knowledge in mind, put yourself in my paws for this one. after 45 minutes or so of anxiously begging to just go back to our room, tearfully insisting we’re going to get in trouble - my family and i stumble upon one of the lower floors of the place. i don’t remember if it was labeled as a basement floor, but i know there was a star attraction that brought us there: the old 60’s ballroom, long left empty. the elevator in this place is to date the slowest and creakiest elevator i’ve ever been on, filling every passing floor with seemingly endless minutes of anticipation. as we walk out into this hall, your senses get overwhelmed by the smell of dust, cigarette smoke, and musty carpet; so it seems that this place has been unoccupied for ages by anyone except those whose curiosity is equally piqued. if you picture the hallway from the shining, you honestly won’t be far off from what my child self is witnessing. it’s a long, dim hallway; the incandescent lights in this place never seeming powerful enough to light up a room without some kind of flicker, and the only sound being it’s faint hum. along the walls are endless golden frames containing what seem to be historical newspaper excerpts, old black and white photos, hand written notes of relevance to the long-gone staff. with this being a floor dedicated to the ball room, the decor is ornate - but vintage, the entire floor exuding this aura of a long history that i wasn’t supposed to be seeing.</p>

<p>reaching my breaking point for the night, i ran down this empty hallway, yelling and begging for my family to please, please take me back to the room (i’m not old enough to stay on my own). due to this, before even reaching the ball room - whose doors sit looming at the very far end of the hall - they decide it’s time to turn around and sleep for the night. clinging to my aunt and trying not to look at all the pictures on the walls, convinced they’ll move, we board back onto the same elevator on which we came. </p>

<p>back down the hall, the smell of cigarettes and dust still hanging in the air - the metal creaks and lurches as we board. not unexpected; i’d had to get used to it due to the peculiar entrance situation, but it still spiked my anxiety every time. luckily, this would be the last time we’d board tonight - so i don’t have to be afraid, we’re going to sleep. as we begin our ascent up, the elevator jerks and metal squeals - a sign of it’s age. slooooowly, bit by bit, the elevator goes up, up… the lights hum in tune, they flicker,</p>

<p>and they go out. </p>

<p>the metal gives one final screech as we jolt to an abrupt stop, suddenly leaving us in total and complete darkness. needless to say, 10 year old chimera immediately lost it’s shit - every single bit of dread i’d felt this entire trip was entirely correct, and this proved it: this was proof of the ghosts haunting the halls, a sign of our bad karma for misbehaving, and now we’re going to die in a shitty elevator with no emergency contact button, no lights, and not even any pictures of that stupid ballroom.</p>

<p>i wish i could say i remember entirely what happens next, but due to the Everything, my memory is blurry. all i know is that somehow, some way, the lights come back - the elevator continues on it’s path, like nothing ever happened. no ghosts, no karma, no nothing. in similar fashion, my family tells me that the solution is simple: teenagers in the elevators before us, playing with the lights through an exposed maintenance panel. of course, i don’t seem to recall any teenagers there - but i was scared shitless. i feel like i would have remembered that, though. i guess the part of the entire experience that’s truly haunting to me is my inability to recall what happened after those lights went out, my lack of trust in my own family’s recollections of such events, and how close we were to winding up in a situation much, much worse.</p>

<p>a sad fact i’ll have to reconcile with - and perhaps the truly scary part of this story - is that this story is painted as something frightening mostly due to it just being a very brazen case of emotional neglect. had i been treated differently, this entire trip could have been a fun, adventurous story with cool sights and shocking twists - and an ending i could actually remember. i suppose the moral of the story is that anything can be a “scary” story - but with the right people, anything can be a fun one, too. let’s all have fun and adventurous stories in the future instead.</p>
